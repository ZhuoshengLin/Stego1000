# Stego1000
A total of 1,000 benchmark images their corresponding prompt keys specifically tailored for the coverless image steganography.
These images are all from publicly available datasets [1,2,3,4,5,6] and can be classified into six categories: animals (300 images), architectures (200 images), cars (200 images), humans (100 images), flowers (100 images), and padang food (100 images). On this basis, corresponding prompts are constructed. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the descriptions of the prompts, we first employ large language models such as ChatGPT to generate the initial drafts of the semantic modification prompts in batches, and then carefully check and optimized each prompt one by one.
